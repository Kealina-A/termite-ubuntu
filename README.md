Termite build script for Ubuntu
=====

Termite terminal build and install script for Ubuntu.
It is based on the [terminal-install](https://github.com/Corwind/termite-install/blob/master/termite-install.sh) script,
but statically link [vte-ng](https://github.com/thestinger/vte-ng) so it does not mess up other vte based terminals.

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04
